# Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1

### Exposure
One vulnerability for us would be our password encryption. we are utilizing Identity to mitigate compromises as compared to SQL Injection.
If we would have used SQL injection and needed to salt/hash our own passwords, this would have allowed malicious users to bypass our encryption.

### Repair
N/A

## Vulnerability 2
### Exposure
Another vulnerability we identified is once our store is deployed, individuals will be able to see who has admin permission along with their email addresses.
### Repair
If we deploy on azure, we would not need to get a cert from a third party which in turn makes it more secure. It would also be wise to store the hard coded admin emails in a database using entity framework.

## Vulnerability 3

### Exposure
`[User.Identity.Name]` Proper access control is one of the features that is embedded in the ASP.NET core. It allows you to validate the current user's name and use that information to access the database and see what is in the cart.

### Repair
In Pages/Cart/Index.cshmtl.cs it contains this access control to validate the current user before accessing the store database. If not done properly, this could potentially open up vulnerability to users data. This is a built in identity package in ASP.NET.

## Vulnerability 4

### Exposure
When accessing `admin` pages, roles are identified and if the logged in user does not have admin role, then it will block them from accessing database information.

### Repair
`[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]` is used to deny access from the normal user. This is implemented in `/Admin/Index.cshtml.cs` which will prevent the user from accessing the dashboard. Any files that is in the admin folder
